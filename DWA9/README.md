What problems did you encounter converting the book preview to a component?
I encountered problems in trying to adjust the existing code to work in the component. Some of the variables are still not functioning correctly when importing and exporting them from and to the component.

What other elements make sense to convert into web components? Why?

I think the search filters can be converted into a component as it would work well in an object style method of coding and simplify the code as well as make it more modular and expandable.

Why does keeping your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file sometimes make sense?

In my case, using a seperate file is proving difficult to access the relevant variables for the component I created.
